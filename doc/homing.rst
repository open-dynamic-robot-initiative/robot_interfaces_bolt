*****************************
Homing and Offset Calibration
*****************************

The homing procedure in robot_interfaces_bolt is the same as in
robot_interfaces_solo, please see the :ref:`documentation of
robot_interfaces_solo <robot_interfaces_solo:homing>`.

The command to run for calibration of BoltHumanoid is

   .. code-block:: bash

      ros2 run bolt bolt_humanoid_hardware_calibration <network-interface>

Apart from this all steps are the same as for Solo.
